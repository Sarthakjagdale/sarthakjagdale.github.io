										<h3 align ="center"> Winning Team at IXL Innovation Consulting</h3>
										<p align ="justify">Won 1st prize for Consulting a European firm "Trelleborg", a polymer-based company to achieve an innovative Business case to acquire the growth gap of €70 Million in the next 3 years. A period of 3 months, where we had to propose the firm’s business leaders with a suitable plan for expansion. Competed against elite B-schools worldwide, also received certification for Innovation Consultant by Global Innovation Management Institute.</p>

										<h3 align ="center">Consulting and Analytics at Harvard Business School</h3>
										<p align ="justify">A business case at Harvard University involving a merger and acquisition case study regarding General Motors entering the Electric vehicle universe by acquiring Tesla motors. My team and I led an in-depth financial analysis using “DCF Model” (Discounted Cash Flow) on both firms to figure out if the deal would result in positive return on investment with a constructive collaboration. Also accomplished, a comprehensive enterprise value for both the firms respectively. Examined other firms that could generate enhanced results for General motors as well as be more reasonable in terms of acquisition, investments, and synergies.</p>

										<h3 align ="center">Impact Choice Award at IBM</h3>
										<p align ="justify">The IBM Innovation challenge was a robust innovation contest that had 4 different verticals as Start-up, Call for Code, IBM Watson, and Cloud. My team and I decided to focus on problems and not on verticals. A severe problem faced by Military Veterans in terms of mental health is Trauma. PSTD, one of the most common disorders, hits to those who face extreme situations on the battlefield. After Brainstorming and researching, we proposed a software “WatchDog” which covered the three verticals (Call for Code, IBM Watson, and Cloud). Our idea was built on a cloud-based platform that aids both medically and situationally inside or outside the battlefield.</p>
